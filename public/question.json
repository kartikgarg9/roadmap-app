      {
        "question": "What is the difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`?",
        "answer": "The main difference is in their scoping and reassignability. `var` is function-scoped, while `let` and `const` are block-scoped. `const` is used for variables that should not be reassigned, while `let` is for variables that can be reassigned.",
        "explanation": "`var` can be redeclared and updated within its scope, whereas `let` and `const` cannot be redeclared within the same scope. `const` also requires initialization when declared."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside of that scope.",
        "explanation": "Closures are created every time a function is created in JavaScript, allowing the function to 'remember' its environment. This is useful for data encapsulation and maintaining state."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "`this` refers to the context in which a function is called. In a method, it refers to the object that owns the method, in a regular function, it refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).",
        "explanation": "In a method, `this` refers to the object that owns the method. In regular functions, it refers to the global object, but this can be different in arrow functions, which do not have their own `this`."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "`==` checks for equality after type coercion, while `===` checks for equality without type coercion.",
        "explanation": "`==` compares values after converting them to a common type, while `===` requires both the type and value to be exactly the same."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is an arrow function in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "An arrow function is a concise way of writing functions. It also binds the value of `this` lexically, meaning it uses `this` from its surrounding context.",
        "explanation": "Arrow functions are useful for short functions and avoid issues with `this` when used in callbacks, unlike regular functions that can change `this` depending on how they are invoked."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is event delegation in JavaScript?",

      {
        "question": "What is async/await in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "async/await is a way to write asynchronous code in a synchronous-looking manner. `async` is used to declare a function that returns a promise, and `await` is used to wait for the resolution of a promise.",
        "explanation": "Using async/await makes it easier to read and write asynchronous code, reducing the need for callback functions and chaining `.then()` methods."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the event loop in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations by placing events in a queue and executing them when the call stack is empty.",
        "explanation": "The event loop enables JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations by executing tasks from the event queue once the current task is complete."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is hoisting in JavaScript?",
        "answer": "Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase.",
        "explanation": "While variable declarations (with `var`) and function declarations are hoisted, only the declarations are moved, not the assignments or function expressions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `typeof` operator in JavaScript?",
